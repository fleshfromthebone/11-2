## With that out of the way, lets dive into methods and working with arrays. Now watered down and simplified for my pea brain.

Like how Python has lists, it seems Javascript has its own version strictly called "arrays", which function almost the same way as lists called by number values ordered by [0], [1], [2], etc whether they be strings or numbers.

```
const numberList = [ "Zero", 1 , 2 , "three", 4 ];
console.log(numberList[0]);
// "zero"
```

### Tampering Methods

Similar to Python's methods, you can use different methods to manipulate the arrays, either adding, removing, or even getting data to and from them.
